An e-commerce website built with the cutting-edge JAMStack.

To setup this project, first node v12 is required as other node versions may not be supported by strapi. This project has been created with node v12.8.3 and strapi v3.1.4. gatsby-cli@2.12.99 is used

@material-ui/core@4.11.0
gatsby-plugin-material-ui@2.1.10
@apollo/client@3.2.9
cross-fetch@3.0.6

Initially, a local mongodb instance is required when creating the strapi backend, but thereafter a mongodb atlas cloud instance is used instead.
